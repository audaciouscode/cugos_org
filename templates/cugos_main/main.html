				<h2>Projects</h2>
				<p>CUGOS tries to maintain active Geo-Spatial projects to help engage the community,

				</div>
				<p>The purpose of roadflaw.com is to provide Seattle, WA area residents with a web 
					application to comment on transportation issues.Issues can be any problem from a 
					pot hole to a bridge that needs to be constructed. The secondary purpose of this 
					project is to provide a learning experience for technology enthusiasts to practice 
					their skills with mapping, and web applications. This project will be built over 
					the course of many weekends and when people feel like contributing.</p>

				<h2>Mission</h2>

				<h2>History</h2>
				<p>Started in February 2007, CUGOS has quickly grown from a core of three 
					founders to a mailing list of over 100 active members. Loosely based on the 
					FRUGOS group, we have held monthly meetings since inception and are active in 
					local, regional and international FOSS GIS activities. In its second year 
					the group has started to branch out into other activities such as hosting code 
					sprints and actively working toward hosting a regional FOSS4G mini-conference.</p>
